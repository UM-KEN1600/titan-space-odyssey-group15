Simulation of a probe launch from Earth to Titan and landing on the surface - Group 15
Requirements: Java installed on computer that is used


This repo is split into: 
- PhysicsEngine
- SolarSystem
- Test
- seperate png files for the images
- README


In order to run the simulation:

Download the .zip or clone this repository to Desktop by using the command below.

git clone <github repository link>

If .zip is downloaded extract the folder into an easily accesible directory.


Follow option A to run using the terminal/cmd and option B to run using an IDE or code compiler

Option A:

1. Using terminal/cmd navigate to the directory where the repository is

2. When in the folder for the project write the following in the terminal
    - javac ./SolarSystem/Main.java

3. Followed by
    - java SolarSystem.Main

4. You will now have a solver selection screen

5. After selecting your preferred solver and pressing run you will run the similation

6. Once the journey to the orbit is complete a landing screen will pop up, displaying the landing of the spaceship on Titan



Option B:


1. Open the folder using your preffered IDE or code compiler

2. In order to run the space simulation select:
- SolarSystem
    - Main.java

3. You will now have a solver selection screen

4. After selecting your preferred solver and pressing run you will run the similation
 
5. Once the journey to the orbit is complete a landing screen will pop up, displaying the landing of the spaceship on Titan
