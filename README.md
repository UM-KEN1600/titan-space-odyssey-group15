README
Simulation of a probe launch from Earth to Titan - Group 15
Requirements: Java installed on computer that is used


This repo is split into: 
- PhysicsEngine
- SolarSystem
- Test
- seperate png files for the images
- README


In order to run the simulation:

Download the .zip or clone this repository to Desktop by using the command below.

git clone <github repository link>

If .zip is downloaded extract the folder into an easily accesible directory.


Follow option A to run using the jar file and option B to run using an IDE or code compiler

Option A:

1. Locate the JAR file

2. Double left click the JAR file

3. You will now have a solver selection screen

4. After selecting your preferred solver and pressing run you will run the similation

5. After the Simulation runs you will get an ending screen showing the fuel consumption and closest distance to Titan



Option B:


1. Open the folder using your preffered IDE or code compiler

2. In order to run the space simulation select:
- SolarSystem
    - Main.java

3. You will now have a solver selection screen

4. After selecting your preferred solver and pressing run you will run the similation

5. After the Simulation runs you will get an ending screen showing the fuel consumption and closest distance to Titan
